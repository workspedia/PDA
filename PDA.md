#### Tracking in a Cluttered Environment With Probabilistic Data Association
This paper presents a new approach to the problem of tracking when the source of the measurement data is uncertain. 

It is assumed that one object of interest ('target') is in track and a number of undesired returns are detected and resolved at a certain time in the neighbourhood of the predicted location of the target's return. 

A suboptimal estimation procedure that takes into account all the measurements that might have originated from the object in track but does not have growing memory and computational requirements is presented. 

The probability of each return ï¼ˆlying in a certain neighborhood of the predicted return, called 'validation region') being correct is obtained--this is called 'probabilistic data association' (PDA).   


#### Sonar Tracking of Multiple Targets Using Joint Probabilistic Data Association  

The problem of associating data with targets in a cluttered multi-target environment is discussed and applied to passive sonar tracking. 

The probabilistic data association (PDA) method, which is based on computing the posterior probability of each candidate measurement found in a validation gate, assumes that only one real target is present and all other measurements are Poisson-distributed clutter. 

In this paper, a new theoretical result is presented: the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, in which joint posterior association probabilities are computed for multiple targets (or multiple discrete interfering sources) in Poisson clutter.


The algorithm is applied to a passive sonar tracking problem with multiple sensors and targets, in which a target is not fully observable from a single sensor.
